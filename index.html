    <!-- Unit 1 - Introduction -->
    <div class="container" id="unit1">
        <h2 class="topic-title"> Introduction</h2>
        <p>Programming in C - Primitive data types, Structures, Self-referential structures, Pointers and structures...
            Structures provide a way to represent real-world entities in a program. For example, if you're working on a program for managing student data, a Student structure could group variables like name, roll number, and marks together. This makes it easier to manage and organize data as a single unit rather than handling individual variables separately
        </p>
        <p>Complexity - Time, Space, Trade-offs.</p>

        <h2 class="topic-title"> List Structure</h2>
        <p>Operations on List ADT - Create, Insert, Search, Delete, Display elements...</p>
        <p>Applications - Sparse Matrix, Polynomial Arithmetic, Josephus Problem.
         <h3>Types of List Structures</h3>
 <h4>The two most common list structures are:</h4>
<h3>Array-Based List:</h3>
A list implemented using a contiguous block of memory, with elements stored in consecutive memory locations.
It allows constant-time access to elements using an index but requires shifting elements during insertions and deletions, which can be inefficient.
<h3>Linked List:</h3><p>
A list where each element (or node) points to the next element in the sequence.
Each node contains the data and a reference (or link) to the next node.</p>

    <!-- Unit 3 - Stack and Queue -->
    <div class="container" id="unit3">
        <h2 class="topic-title"> Stack and Queue</h2>
        <p>Operations on Stack ADT - Create, Push, Pop, Top; Implementation of Stack ADT...</p>
        <p>Applications - Scheduling, Balancing Symbols, Tower of Hanoi.
            we also preform a role play using queue
        </p>
        <p>Stack and Queue are two fundamental data structures in computer science, used for organizing data with different methods for adding (inserting) and removing (deleting) elements.

         <h3>   1. Stack</h3>
            Definition: A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be 
            
            Operations:
            
            Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
            Pop: Removes the element from the top of the stack.
            Peek (or Top): Returns the element at the top without removing it.
            Applications:
            
            Function call management in programming languages (keeping track of function calls in recursion).
            Undo operations in applications (reversing recent changes).
            Expression evaluation and syntax parsing (for balancing parentheses, converting infix expressions to postfix/prefix).
            Visualization: Imagine a stack of plates; you add (push) plates on top, and when you remove (pop) a plate, you take the top one.
            
            <h3>  2. Queue </h3>
            Definition: A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed.
            
            Operations:
            
            Enqueue: Adds an element to the end (rear) of the queue.
            Dequeue: Removes the element from the front of the queue.
            Front (or Peek): Returns the element at the front without removing it.
            Applications:
            
            Task scheduling (like handling processes in an operating system).
            Handling requests in web servers.
            Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graph traversal.
            Visualization: Imagine a line of people waiting; the first person in line is served first, and new people join at the end.
